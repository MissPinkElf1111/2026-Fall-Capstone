# Beyond RanSMAP: Enhanced Behavioral Ransomware Detection with Engineered Features and Hybrid Deep Learning

**MSc Applied Computer Science | Fairleigh Dickinson University**  
**Fall 2026 Capstone Project | Group 1**

## Overview

This project implements an offline ransomware detection pipeline using low-level storage and memory access traces from the RanSAP and RanSMAP datasets.

The current experiment focuses on WannaCry ransomware and benign activity from Firefox, Microsoft Office, and Zip.

The pipeline extracts behavioural features, trains models on benign activity, and identifies executions with unusual behaviour. It includes:

- 26 storage features and 60 memory features.
- Separate storage and memory autoencoders.
- Isolation Forest comparison models.
- Temporal scoring of autoencoder reconstruction errors.
- Score-level fusion of storage and memory results.
- Execution-level detection evaluation.

| Folder | Expected Data | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RanSAP/` | WannaCry storage traces | `1` — ransomware |
| `RanSMAP/` | WannaCry storage and memory traces | `1` — ransomware |
| `Benign/` | Firefox, Office, and Zip storage and memory traces | `0` — benign |

### Supported Source Files

The scripts search recursively for headerless CSV files with these suffixes:

| Filename Suffix | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `ata_read.csv` | Storage read |
| `ata_write.csv` | Storage write |
| `mem_read.csv` | Memory read |
| `mem_write.csv` | Memory write |
| `mem_readwrite.csv` | Memory read and write |
| `mem_exec.csv` | Memory execute |

The expected schemas are defined in `02_analyze_data.py`, `03_combine_data.py`, and `04_prepare_data.py`.

Fields include timestamp components, logical block addresses (LBA), guest physical addresses (GPA), access sizes, and entropy values where available. Column order differs between datasets and operations and must match the schemas in the code.

### Execution Naming

Source filenames are used to identify executions.

For example:

```text
sample01_ata_read.csv
sample01_ata_write.csv
sample01_mem_read.csv
sample01_mem_write.csv
```

These files map to execution ID `sample01`.

For files named only by operation, such as `ata_read.csv`, the relative parent directory supplies the execution ID.

Execution IDs must distinguish separate runs within each dataset. Storage and memory traces from the same run must have matching IDs for fusion.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MissPinkElf1111/2026-Fall-Capstone.git
cd 2026-Fall-Capstone
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Or on macOS/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn torch joblib matplotlib
```

The repository does not currently include pinned dependency versions. Record the Python and package versions used for each experiment.

PyTorch uses CUDA when available and otherwise runs on the CPU.

## Running the Pipeline

Run the scripts from the repository root in this order:

```bash
python 01_inspect_data.py
python 02_analyze_data.py
python 03_combine_data.py
python 04_prepare_data.py
python 05_feature_engineering.py
python 06_split_data.py
python 07_train_models.py
python 08_evaluate_models.py
python 09_analyze_evalutaion.py
python 10_evaluate_detection.py
```

All file paths are relative to the current working directory. Output directories are created automatically.

Steps 09 and 10 both use Step 08 outputs. Step 10 does not require Step 09.

Rerunning a stage can overwrite previous outputs. Preserve experiment results before changing settings or rerunning the pipeline.

For environments without a graphical display, set `MPLBACKEND=Agg` before running the plotting scripts.

## Implementation

### Data Combination and Cleaning

`03_combine_data.py` combines traces separately by dataset and operation. It adds:

- `source_file_id`: the original file path relative to its dataset folder.
- `source_row`: the original row number.

These fields preserve the source information needed to identify executions.

`04_prepare_data.py` removes unused placeholder columns and rejects records with invalid source identifiers, missing retained values, or invalid numeric fields.

### Feature Extraction

`05_feature_engineering.py` aggregates access events into **0.1-second windows**.

| Modality | Feature Count | Main Feature Groups |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | 26 | Operation counts, byte totals, throughput, request sizes, address variation, read/write ratios, and write entropy |
| Memory | 60 | Read/write/readwrite/execute activity, operation ratios, reported byte totals, access sizes, address behaviour, and entropy |
| Total | 86 | Separate storage and memory feature sets |

The following metadata is retained separately from the model features:

```text
dataset
execution_id
label
window_start_ns
window_end_ns
```

Features are written to six files:

```text
features/storage_read_features.csv
features/storage_write_features.csv
features/memory_read_features.csv
features/memory_write_features.csv
features/memory_readwrite_features.csv
features/memory_execute_features.csv
```

The training and evaluation scripts merge the operation-specific features using their shared execution and window keys.

### Execution-Level Splitting

`06_split_data.py` uses target proportions of:

- 70% training.
- 15% validation.
- 15% testing.

The split is stratified by binary label and uses random seed `42`.

Each `(dataset, execution_id)` receives one shared assignment across feature files. All windows from that execution remain in the same partition, reducing the risk of data leakage between training and testing.

Assignments are saved in:

```text
splits/execution_split_assignments.csv
```

### Model Training

`07_train_models.py` trains four models:

1. Storage autoencoder.
2. Memory autoencoder.
3. Storage Isolation Forest.
4. Memory Isolation Forest.

Only benign training windows are used to fit the models. Benign validation windows are used for autoencoder early stopping and novelty calibration.

A `StandardScaler` is fitted on benign training features and reused for validation and test data.

#### Autoencoders

The autoencoders learn to reconstruct benign feature vectors. Mean squared reconstruction error is used as an anomaly score.

The architecture is:

```text
Input → Hidden Layer → Latent Layer → Hidden Layer → Reconstruction
```

| Model | Input Features | Hidden Units | Latent Units |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Storage autoencoder | 26 | 13 | 6 |
| Memory autoencoder | 60 | 30 | 15 |

#### Isolation Forest

Separate Isolation Forest models provide comparison scores for storage and memory.

The implementation uses negative `score_samples` values so that higher scores indicate more unusual behaviour.

### Temporal Scoring

`08_evaluate_models.py` calculates a five-window rolling mean of autoencoder reconstruction errors within each execution.

Five complete windows represent 0.5 seconds of activity. Initial windows use the available shorter history.

Temporal scoring processes the autoencoder errors; it is not a separately trained model.

### Score-Level Fusion

The combined method, named `DTBAD_combined` in the code, integrates normalised storage and memory temporal scores:

```text
Combined score =
    0.50 × normalised storage temporal score
  + 0.50 × normalised memory temporal score
```

Normalisation uses benign validation statistics.

Fusion is performed on matching RanSMAP and Benign execution summaries. RanSAP is evaluated through storage models only because it does not contain memory traces.

### Detection Evaluation

`10_evaluate_detection.py` calibrates each execution-level threshold at the **95th percentile of benign validation execution scores**.

The decision rule is:

```text
Score > threshold → ransomware
Score ≤ threshold → benign
```

Test labels are used to evaluate predictions after threshold calibration.

The script calculates accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, false positive rate, false negative rate, balanced accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix counts.

Anomaly scores indicate deviation from learned benign behaviour. They are not ransomware probabilities.

## Main Configuration

Settings are defined as constants inside the scripts.

| Setting | Default | Script |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature window | 0.1 seconds | `05_feature_engineering.py` |
| Train / validation / test ratios | 70% / 15% / 15% | `06_split_data.py` |
| Random seed | 42 | `06_split_data.py`, `07_train_models.py` |
| Training batch size | 256 | `07_train_models.py` |
| Maximum epochs | 100 | `07_train_models.py` |
| Early stopping patience | 10 | `07_train_models.py` |
| Learning rate | 0.001 | `07_train_models.py` |
| Isolation Forest estimators | 200 | `07_train_models.py` |
| Temporal rolling window | 5 windows | `08_evaluate_models.py` |
| Storage / memory fusion weights | 0.50 / 0.50 | `08_evaluate_models.py` |
| Execution detection percentile | 95 | `10_evaluate_detection.py` |

After changing an upstream setting, rerun the affected stage and its downstream stages.

## Preliminary Results

The following results are reported in the October 19, 2026 midterm report.

### Data Partitions

| Partition | Executions |
| --- | --- |
| Training | 250 |
| Validation | 54 |
| Test | 56 |
| Total | 360 |

These are overall partition counts. Model fitting uses only the benign windows selected from the training partition.

### Test Set Composition

| Evaluation Set | Benign | Ransomware | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | 28 | 28 | 56 |
| Memory | 28 | 7 | 35 |
| Combined | 28 | 7 | 35 |

The storage ransomware set contains 21 RanSAP and 7 RanSMAP executions. Memory and combined evaluation use the 7 RanSMAP ransomware executions.

### Detection Performance

Ransomware is the positive class.

| Method | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Storage Autoencoder | 96.43% | 93.33% | 100.00% | 96.55% | 99.49% |
| Storage Temporal | 96.43% | 93.33% | 100.00% | 96.55% | 99.49% |
| Storage Isolation Forest | 92.86% | 96.15% | 89.29% | 92.59% | 98.47% |
| Memory Autoencoder | 88.57% | 71.43% | 71.43% | 71.43% | 94.39% |
| Memory Temporal | 80.00% | 50.00% | 57.14% | 53.33% | 91.84% |
| Memory Isolation Forest | 88.57% | 71.43% | 71.43% | 71.43% | 95.41% |
| Combined | 94.29% | 77.78% | 100.00% | 87.50% | 98.47% |

The storage autoencoder and temporal methods detected all 28 ransomware executions, with 2 false positives each.

The combined method detected all 7 ransomware executions and produced 2 false positives. Memory methods achieved lower F1 scores in this experiment.

Storage and combined methods use different test sets. Their relative performance must be assessed on the same executions before drawing conclusions about the benefit of fusion.

Training epochs and validation reconstruction losses are not reported in the midterm report. These values are printed by `07_train_models.py`.

## Limitations and Planned Work

The current experiment covers WannaCry only and uses a small test set. Cross-dataset and cross-hardware generalisation have not yet been established.

The report also records variation in memory results between two laptop runs, which requires further investigation.

Planned work includes:

- Additional trace collection using BitVisor and Windows 10.
- Random Forest and 1D-CNN–LSTM comparison models.
- Cross-dataset and cross-hardware testing.
- Feature and window-size ablation.
- Repeated experiments with multiple random seeds.
- Alternative score-fusion methods.
- Comparisons using the same execution sets.

The current repository contains scripts 01–10. The planned generalisation stage is not included in the reviewed implementation.
